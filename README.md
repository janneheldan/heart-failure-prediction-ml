# Heart-Failure-Prediction

This project explores various machine learning algorithms for a binary classification task using the Heart Failure Prediction dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 918 observations with 12 attributes, where the target variable (y) is "HeartDisease":
* 0: No heart failure
* 1: Heart failure

### Objective
The goal is to compare the performance of different machine learning models in predicting heart failure.


### Machine Learning Models Considered
The following classification algorithms will be implemented and evaluated:
* Logistic Regression Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* KNN
